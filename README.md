# Predictive Product Recommendation Model for BEES App
Project Overview
A leading brewery aims to enhance its app by implementing a predictive product recommendation system. This system predicts products that customers are likely to purchase in their next order, based on their past behavior and other relevant features. The goal is to improve user experience and drive sales growth.

## Approach

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyzed user activity to identify repeat purchase patterns.
Assessed product importance and market variability.
Examined customer preferences based on socioeconomic status (NSE).

### Feature Engineering:
Derived key features such as has_bought_before, product_importance, and NSE.

### Model Development:
Developed simple, robust classification models to predict next purchases.
Ensured models were resistant to overfitting and optimized for real-world customer data.

### Integration:
Seamlessly integrated the predictive model into the BEES app for real-time recommendations.
